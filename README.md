# iltalk-protobuf
The iltalk-protobuf (InterLingual-Talk) plugin performs the interlingual bidirectional procedural calls which are unlimited in depth (reentrant) and also are unlimited in the choice of a language pair. 
The language pair must support the **Google Protobuf** library and its extensions. the default pair is `Java/Logtalk.`

The repository is still under development, thus the project is unbildable.
